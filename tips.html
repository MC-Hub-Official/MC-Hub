      <h3> The fastest ways to move </h3>
      <p> In Survival, the fastest way to move is sprinting while jumping roughly every second, standing on ice with trapdoors above you. The effects of Speed help too. </p>
      <p> When on the move, avoid soul, slime and honey blocks. Crouching will slow you down too, as well as the effects of Slowness. </p>
      <p> In Creative mode, try sprinting while flying. You go really fast. Soul Speed on boots will speed you up on soul blocks. </p>

      <h3> Find ore </h3>
      <p> One of the best ways to find ore in Minecraft is to start a strip mine. </p>
      <p> A strip mine is a long horizontal mine at a specific Y level. </p>
      <p> For diamonds, it's best to start from Y levels 1-15. For iron, try Y level 50. </p>
      <p> For coal, level 60. AAAANND for Netherite (Ancient Debris) try levels 15-17 in the Nether. </p>
      <p> You can also find diamonds in village chests and other chests. </p>

      <h3> Never mine straight down </h3>
      <p> Never mine straight down in Survival. There are many lava lakes and mob-filled caves you could fall into. </p>
      <p> If you absolutely have to, stand in the middle of two blocks, mine one, then the other, in alternate patterns. </p>
      <p> This will allow you to see what's below you before you fall in. </p>

      <h3> The best ways to fight a blaze </h3>
      <p> Build a complete wall around the blaze spawner allowing them no space. Don't forget the roof. </p>
      <p> Then go outside the wall and break one block, and only one. Then you can attack them through the hole. </p>

      <h3> Bring water buckets to the End </h3>
      <p> You can use them to surround yourself in water when endermen are attacking you. </p>
      <p> Endermen are allergic to water so the will then not be able to get to you. </p>
      <p> You can also use them to break your fall off an obsidian pillar. </p>
      <p> You can also use Feather Falling on boots to break your fall, but you will still take some damage. </p>

      <h3> Bookshelves enchance your enchantment table </h3>
      <p> You can put 15 bookshelves in a 1-block high wall around your table to make it look especially nice. </p>
      <p> This will greatly enchance the power of the table and give you much better enchantments. </p>
      <p> Leave one block for the entrance. There are many other bookshelf formations that will look equally - or more - nice. </p>

      <h3> Always wear golden armour to the Nether </h3>
      <p> Always wear at least one piece of golden armour when entering the Nether. </p>
      <p> Piglins do not attack you when you wear golden armour unless you attack them or mine nearby Nether Gold. </p>

      <h3> Use ยง (section sign) </h3>
      <p> If you use ยง followed by a specific letter or number in a command or in the chat, it will make whatever you are writing colorful! </p>
      <p> a = green, b = blue, c = red, d = purple, e = yellow, f = white, to name a few. <p> 
      <p> Not all characters work! </p>
